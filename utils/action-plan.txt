STEP BY STEP PLAN FOR AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM:

Step 1: Project Setup
Backend (Node.js)
1.1. Initialize a new Node.js project.
1.2. Install necessary packages (express, mongoose, passport, passport-local, bcryptjs, express-session).

Frontend (React)
1.3. Create a new React app using create-react-app.
1.4. Navigate into the client directory.

Step 2: Backend Setup
2.1. Configure Express
2.1.1. Create server.js for Express setup.
2.1.2. Set up Express with middleware (express.json(), express-session, passport).
I would suggest using a combination of sessions with secure, HttpOnly cookies for authentication and authorization. and sameSite attribute for cookies.
2.1.3. Connect to MongoDB using mongoose.
2.1.4. Set up routes for authentication (to be implemented later).

2.2. Create User Model
2.2.1. Create a models folder.
2.2.2. Inside models, create User.js for the user model.
2.2.3. Define the user schema including fields like username and password.

2.3. Configure Passport Local Strategy
2.3.1. Create passport-config.js.
2.3.2. Set up a local strategy for passport.
2.3.3. Configure serialization and deserialization for user sessions.

2.4. Express Routes for Authentication
2.4.1. Create routes folder.
2.4.2. Inside routes, create auth.js for authentication routes.
2.4.3. Implement registration, login, and logout routes.

2.5. Integrate Routes in server.js
2.5.1. Import and use authentication routes in server.js.

Step 3: Frontend Setup
3.1. Axios Installation
3.1.1. Navigate into the client directory.
3.1.2. Install Axios for making HTTP requests.

3.2. User Registration and Login Components
3.2.1. Create components for user registration and login.

3.3. User Registration and Login Forms
3.3.1. Implement forms in the registration and login components.

3.4. Axios Requests
3.4.1. Use Axios to make requests to the backend for registration and login.

3.5. Store User Information
3.5.1. Handle user information after successful login.

Step 4: Secure Sessions and Cookies
4.1. Enable Sessions in Express
4.1.1. Configure your Express app to use sessions and cookies.

4.2. Use express-session Middleware
4.2.1. Integrate express-session middleware in server.js.

Step 5: Encryption/Decryption of Journal Content
5.1. Choose a Cipher Library
5.1.1. Select a library or method for encryption/decryption of journal content.

This plan provides a structured approach to set up the authentication system in your React and Node.js application. Each step builds upon the previous one, ensuring a methodical and organized development process. Once you're ready to move to the next phase (coding), feel free to ask for assistance with specific code implementation or any questions you may have along the way.
